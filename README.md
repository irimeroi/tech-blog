# tech-blog
## Description
For this project I created a blog where users can share their thoughts and opinions about tech. It also allows other users to comment on the posts already created.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
This blog allows every user to view the different posts already created, and gives the option to leave a comment without the need to leave any personal information into the plataform. However, it's necessary to either sign up or login (if re-visiting), in order to create, update or delete posts. If the user decides to create a post, they must add a title and a description, and the actual date will be automatically provided.

## Credits
I was able to create this code thanks to the help of the TA, tutors and old codes that were given to us as learning tools.
